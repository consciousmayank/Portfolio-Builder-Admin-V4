# Portfolio Admin V4 - GitHub Setup Guide

## 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository with:
- **Repository name**: `portfolio-admin-v4`
- **Description**: Flutter admin panel application with Riverpod state management, Hive local storage, and PocketBase integration
- **Visibility**: Public
- **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Remove the temporary remote if it exists
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null || true

# Add the correct GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-admin-v4.git

# Rename the main branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

## 3. Verify Upload

Visit your repository at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-admin-v4`

You should see all your Flutter project files uploaded successfully.
